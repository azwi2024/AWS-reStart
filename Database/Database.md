 Types of databases
* Relational Databases (SQL)
 Store data in tables with rows and columns. Use Structured Query Language (SQL) to manage data. Great for structured data with clear relationships (e.g., customer orders).
  Examples: Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora, MySQL, PostgreSQL.
 
* Graph Databases
 Store data as nodes and relationships (like a social network). Best for data that's all about connections.
      Example: Amazon Neptune.

*NoSQL Databases
Handle unstructured or semi-structured data (like documents or key-value pairs).More flexible than SQL, great for fast-growing, unpredictable data.
 Examples: Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Document DB.

*In-Memory Databases
Store data in RAM for super-fast access.Ideal for real-time apps, caching, or gaming.
 Examples: Amazon ElastiCache (Redis/Memcached), Amazon MemoryDB

* Data Warehouses
 Designed for analytics and reporting over large datasets. Used for business intelligence and decision-making. 
 Example: Amazon Redshift.
