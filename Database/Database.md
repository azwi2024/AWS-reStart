Importance of databases
1. Efficient scaling
2. Data integrity
3. Data security
4. Data analytics

 Types of databases
1. Relational Databases (SQL)
  Store data in tables with rows and columns. Use Structured Query Language (SQL) to manage data. 
  Examples: Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora, MySQL, PostgreSQL.
 
2. Graph Databases
 Store data as nodes and relationships (like a social network). Best for data that's all about connections.
 Example: Amazon Neptune.

3.NoSQL Databases
 Handle unstructured or semi-structured data (like documents or key-value pairs).
 Examples: Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Document DB.

4.In-Memory Databases
 Store data in RAM for super-fast access.Ideal for real-time apps, caching, or gaming.
 Examples: Amazon ElastiCache (Redis/Memcached), Amazon MemoryDB

5.Data Warehouses
 Designed for analytics and reporting over large datasets. Used for business intelligence and decision-making. 
 Example: Amazon Redshift.
